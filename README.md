# Optikos

A simple project management tool that allows users to visually organize tasks by creating work flows.

* [Presentation]() - Team presentation
* [Demo](https://optikos-demo.herokuapp.com) - Example demo
  * Serialize/deserialized feature turned off due to edge case issues, position of diagrams will be reset
  * Users need to refresh in order for sidebar to show new tasks that have been added

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
